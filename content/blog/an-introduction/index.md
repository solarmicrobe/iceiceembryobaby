Quite a few people in our life know that we are walking through the process of Embryo Adoption. Some
of you don’t. We have had so many questions about the process, so I decided to put our life and info
into a blog, partly to process it myself but also to give our family and friends a place to read and ask all
the questions. I’m in no way an expert but I have been researching since high school, almost 20 years
ago.

# How did you decide on embryo adoption?
Growing up my parents had always instilled a respect for life into my brother and I. Even as small
children my mother allowed up to save a baby bird and try to nurse it back to health. (I’ll have to ask my
mom what ever happened to that baby bird :)) We also had a kitty that was rescued from my dad’s
warehouse who was so small we had to bottle fed her. So, life at all stages and creatures has always
been precious to me and to be valued and not allowed to suffer as far as it is up to us. Now there are
many people who don’t believe that life begins before birth, but I’m not here to argue that point at this
time, I’m just explaining where I’m coming from. In our high school government class our teacher had us
research a bill, write and then present it in class and have it voted on. His intention was to have us write
a Kansas state bill to learn how bills were made into law. Because I had decided at a young age I was
going to go into politics and change the world and be president of the US I asked if mine could be a
federal bill, my teacher agreed. I knew already that I wanted to craft a pro-life bill and started down that
path. My mother, being the person she is, started inundating me with information and magazine
articles. I stumbled upon an article about “snowflake babies” and decided to write my bill to protect
them. My bill was voted down in class but I received an A for my research. During that time I overheard
my aunt talking to a friend about her embryos and trying to decide what to do with them. This solidified
my decision to someday want adopt an embryo.
What is a snowflake baby?
When I decided to start our blog I threw out some ideas for the address and Russell and I talked about
iceicebaby.com, the problem with that website is that while it isn’t owned by vanilla ice, it is owned by
someone probably hoping someday to sell it to him! Embryos left over from IVF are frozen in liquid
nitrogen and each one is unique just like snowflakes.

# Why are there extra embryos to adopt?
Infertile couples have several options to expand their family biologically. One of the last and most
expensive options is in vitro fertilization. This is done by creating an embryo using a man’s sperm and a
women’s egg to create, in a lab, several embryos. The amount of embryos created are mainly
determined by the amount of eggs available, either from the biological mother or an egg donor. There
are additional factors that go into the final number but if you want to know more scientific info you can
[read here](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716).

So lets say there were 15 embryos created and it is decided that a family is complete after two babies
are born. This leaves 13 embryos frozen (assuming that none were implanted and didn’t result in a
pregnancy or all of them survived being thawed to be used. See how it can become complicated? These
13 embryos must be stored in a facility and storage fees of hundreds-thousands of dollars are incurred
every year. I had someone ask me why we just can’t adopt and embryo and keep them in our deep
freeze and while this is a good question, liquid nitrogen must be frozen at a very, very low temperature
not to mention is human tissue and the last time I heard about someone keeping that in their fridge
they were arrested. So people are forced to make a decision or pay storage fees.
What happens to extra embryos?
The person(s) that created the embryos or were involved in birthing a child as a result of the implanted
embryos (which could end up being up to 5 people (egg donor, sperm donor, surrogate, adoption dad,
adoption mom) have 3 choices.
1. Donate the additional embryos to science, where they will be destroyed, and the tissue will be
used to research
2. Continue to pay for storage indefinitely and have their contract or heirs decide what to do with
them.
3. Go through an embryo adoption agency to let others (many times infertile couples) adopt their
embryos and give them a chance at life.
Growing up and in the first part of our marriage because of different diagnosis I had I thought I would
have trouble getting pregnant. Hashimoto’s disease and a Dr had thought I might have PCOS. I
researched IVF and snowflake babies extensively not only because of the events in high school but just
because I wanted to know what I would go through and have to decide if we did need to travel that
path. It was quite a surprise to me when we found our we were pregnant with our first daughter, Skylar
and later with Baylee. I was very happy and excited we were able to have our girls without reproductive
help but all the research had opened my eyes to a whole other world of women struggling to conceive.
Additional I had a couple of cousins who used IVF to bring their babies into the world and although I
don’t have the first had knowledge of what they have gone through I know they are made many difficult
decisions and sacrifices to bring their babies home. I felt that if I could help even one couple feel better
about their embryos, by giving them a chance and eventually giving them a home, I could help ease
some of the pain that comes with infertility. This has always been my heart and before Russell and I
were married it was something that we talked about and knew someday we were do. After our girls
were born we both knew our family wasn’t complete but we were ready to “give birth to our adopted
child.”
